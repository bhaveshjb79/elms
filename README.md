This project is aimed at developing an online leave management system that is of importance to either an organization. The Employee Leave Management System (ELMS) is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the organization or a specified group/Dept. This system can be used to automate the workflow of leave applications and their approvals. The periodic crediting of leave is also automated. There are features like email notifications, automatic approval of leave, report generators etc in this system. Leave Management application will reduce paper work and maintains record in more efficient way.

                                              	Introduction
In the existing paper work related to leave management, leaves are maintained using the attendance register for staff. The staff needs to submit their leaves manually to their respective authorities. This increases the paperwork & maintaining the records becomes tedious. Maintaining notices in the records also increases the paperwork. The main objective of the proposed system is to decrease the paperwork and help in easier record maintenance by having a particular centralized Database System, where Leaves and Notices are maintained. The proposed system automates the existing system. It decreases the paperwork and enables easier record maintenance. It also reduces chances of Data loss. This module intelligently adapts to HR policy of the management & allows employees and their line managers to manage leaves and replacements for better scheduling of workload.
